# fabric-operation

Operation scripts for creating and managing Hyperledger Fabric networks.

## Prerequisites
* Install Docker and Docker Compose as described [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Start CA server and generate crypto and MSP definitions
* Define Fabric network in [config](./config), e.g., [sample network](./config/netop1.env) operated by an organization named _netop1.com_.
* Start CA server of the sample operator organization, _netop1.com_, using the script [start-ca.sh](./ca/start-ca.sh).
* Generate crypto and MSP definitions by the CA server, using the script [set-msp.sh](./ca/set-msp.sh).
* Shutdown CA server and cleanup working files, using the script [stop-ca.sh](./ca/stop-ca.sh).

## Sample crypto and MSP definitions
Sample MSP definitions generated by the above steps are show in [netop1.com](./netop1.com).

It uses the same folder structure as the result from _cryptogen_ as described by [fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples). However, by using CA server, our scripts are more flexible and adaptable to production environment.

## Start sample Fabric network, and verify the crypto data
Refer the steps described in [netop1-network](./netop1-network) for how to use the generated crypto data in a Fabric network.
