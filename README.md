# fabric-operation

This project contains scripts that let you define, create, and test a Hyperledger Fabric network based on a set of parameters as specified in a sample network, [netop1.env](./config/netop1.env).

The scripts support both `docker-compose` and `kubernetes`.  All steps are done in docker containers, and thus you can get a Fabric network running without pre-downloading anything.

## Prerequisites
* Your workstation must support `bash` shell scripts.
* If you want to create and test a Fabric network on local host, you need to install docker-compose and/or kubernetes locally, i.e.,
  * Install Docker and Docker Compose as described [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
  * Mac user can enable kubernetes as described [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes).
  * I have not tested the scripts with [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/), although I would expect it to work without much change.
* If you want to create and test a Fabric network in a cloud, you would not need to download anything except a `CLI` required to access the corresponding cloud service.  We currently support Amazon EKS, and Azure AKS.  Other cloud services will be supported in the future as well. 
  * For AWS, refer the scripts and instructions in the [aws folder](./aws).
  * For Azure, refer the scripts and instructions in the [az folder](./az).

## Start CA server and generate crypto data
Following steps start `fabric-ca` PODs in Kubernetes and generate crypto data required by the sample network, `netop1`.
```
cd ./ca
./start-ca.sh
./bootstrap.sh
./stop-ca.sh
```
You can edit the network specification [netop1.env](./config/netop1.env) if you want to use a different operator name, or make it run more orderer or peer nodes.  The generated crypto data will be stored in the folder [netop1.com](./netop1.com) on localhost, or in the cloud, such as Amazon EFS file system, or an Azure File storage. 

These scripts take 2 additional parameters, e.g.,
```
./start-ca.sh config_file env_type
```
where `config_file` is file in the [config](./config) folder with a suffix `.env` that contains the fabric network specification; `env_type` can be `k8s`, `docker`, `aws`, or `az`. 
* `k8s` uses the local `docker-desktop` kubernetes on Mac, 
* `docker` uses `docker-compose`, and 
* `aws` uses AWS EKS when executed on a `bastion` host of an EC2 instance.
* `az` uses Azure AKS when executed on a `bastion` VM instance in Azure.
More cloud support will be added in the future.

## Sample crypto data
When the above steps are executed on localhost, the crypto data will be stored in [netop1.com](./netop1.com/).  The resulting crypto data is similar to that generated by the fabric `cryptogen` tool as demonstrated by [fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples). However, by using a fabric CA server in the above step, the generated certificates will include a few extra attributes that would make them usable for cloud deployment using kubernetes, as well as attribute-based-access-control (ABAC).  Besides, CA server is also more flexible for generating certificates for more nodes and users in production environment as the network grows.

You may test how the generated crypto data work using a preconfigured sample network as described in [docker-netop1](./docker-netop1).  However, if you do not have a local hyperledger fabric environment, you can skip the test and read on.  The following steps will show you how to start a fabric network by using a few simple scripts even if you do not have a fabric development environment.

## Generate MSP definition and genesis block
The following script generates a genesis block for the sample network for Kubernetes using 2 peers and 3 orderers with `etcd raft` consensus.
```
cd ./msp
./bootstrap.sh
```
It also generates transactions for creating a test channel, `mychannel`, for smoke tests.  Similar to other scripts, this command also accepts 2 parameters, `config-file` and `env-type` for using different network definition file, or generating artifacts for other deployment environment, e.g., `docker`, `aws`, or `az`.

## Start and smoke test the Fabric network
The following script will start and test the sample fabric network by using the `docker-desktop` Kubernetes on a Mac:
```
cd ./network
./start-k8s.sh
./k8s-test.sh
./stop-k8s.sh
```
Before you shutdown the network by using [`stop-k8s.sh`](./network/stop-k8s.sh), you can verify the running fabric containers by using `kubectl`, e.g.,
```
kubectl get pod,svc --namespace netop1
```
Note that the scripts use the operating company name, `netop1`, as a Kubernetes namespace, and so they can support multiple member organizations.

If you are not using a Mac, you can run these scripts using `docker-compose`, `Amazon EKS`, or `Azure AKS`. Simply add 2 parameters to all the commands, e.g.,
* `./start-ca.sh netop1 docker` to use `docker-composer`, or
* `./start-ca.sh netop1 aws` when executing the commands on a `bastion host` of EC2 instance, which is described in the folder [aws](./aws), or
* `./start-ca.sh netop1 az` when executing the commands on the `bastion host` of Azure VM intance, which is described in the folder [az](./az).
You may also try to verify if the scripts would work on [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

After the smoke test succeeds, you should see a test result of `90` printed on the screen. If you used `docker-compose` for this excersize, you can look at the blockchain state via the `CouchDB` futon UI at `http://localhost:7056/_utils`, which is exposed for `docker-compose` only because it is not recommended to expose `CouchDB` in production configuration using Kubernetes.

## TODO
Stay tuned for more updates on the following items:
* Add new orderer org and orderer nodes;
* Add new peer org and peer nodes;
* Support Google GKE
* Deploy new chaincode
